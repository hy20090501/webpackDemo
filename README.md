## Libraries

### jquery + jquery-ui

Files: `jquery.html` with `app/jquery`

jQuery versions `>= 1.10` have commonjs support. For this versions no special config is required.

jQuery version `1.9` has only AMD support, but also needs a `amd: { jQuery: true }` in the `webpack.config.js`

jQuery-ui has no commonjs/AMD support. It expects `jQuery` as global variable. Currently jQuery expose ifself as global variable even if a module system is found, but this may change. One can use the `webpack.ProvidePlugin` (see `webpack.config.js`) to provide modules as (fake) global variables.
